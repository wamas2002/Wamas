## Critical Findings

### üî¥ **IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED**

   - Manual intervention required for loss management
   - Tables created but system not activated

3. **Limited Trading Volume**

   - Signal execution may be too conservative
   - Potential missed opportunities

### üü° **OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES**

1. **Signal Confidence Optimization**
   - Current threshold may be too high
   - Consider lowering from 75% to 65% for more signals
   - Retrain models with recent market data

   - Target allocation limits per asset
   - Regular portfolio review cycles
