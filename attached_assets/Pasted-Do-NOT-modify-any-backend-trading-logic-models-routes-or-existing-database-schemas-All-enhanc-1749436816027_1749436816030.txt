Do NOT modify any backend trading logic, models, routes, or existing database schemas.
⚠️ All enhancements must be modular plugins or UI extensions and use the current data structure.

🧠 OBJECTIVE:
Enhance the current system to support TrendSpider-style smart tools and AI-assisted strategy evaluation features.

✅ ADD THESE MODULES:

1. 📈 Anchored VWAP Visual Tool
   - Allow manual or automatic anchoring (e.g., swing high/low, breakout candle)
   - Overlay anchored VWAP on TradingView widget

2. 🔢 Auto-Fibonacci Detector
   - Automatically draw Fib levels from last major pivot high/low on chart
   - Use TA-Lib or pandas_ta to identify pivots

3. 🎯 Real-Time Signal Screener
   - Add a screener panel for multi-condition filters:
     - RSI, MACD, EMA cross, volume > avg, etc.
     - Timeframe filters (1h, 4h, 1d)
   - Show filtered results in live-updating dashboard

4. 🧮 Strategy Parameter Heatmap
   - Run backtests on combinations of strategy parameters
   - Visualize results in a 2D heatmap grid (e.g., EMA Fast vs EMA Slow)

5. 🕹️ Signal Replay Module
   - On chart, replay past signals with entry/exit markers
   - Annotate outcomes and performance per signal

6. 📤 Export Backtest Logs
   - Enable export of backtest runs to CSV/Excel
   - Include timestamps, parameters, PnL, win/loss

7. 🧩 Modular Plugin Framework
   - Create a base plugins/ directory
   - Each plugin should register to the core system via dependency injection or dynamic import
   - Use current system data flow and models

8. 📅 Optional: Seasonality Analyzer
   - Add module to detect and visualize historical performance by month/week
   - Include filters per coin

✅ UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Integrate enhancements visually into the new UI at port :3000
- Place chart tools as overlays inside TradingView widgets
- Screener and heatmaps go into a new "Smart Scanner" tab

✅ FINAL GOAL:
Replicate key TrendSpider functionalities as non-invasive modular tools.
Do not touch the current AI models, OKX integration, or strategy engine — just expand features intelligently.
