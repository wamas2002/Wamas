Key AI Features in MVP:

Market regime detection to classify trending vs ranging vs volatile markets
Q-learning reinforcement learning agent with epsilon-greedy exploration
Volatility-adjusted position sizing that adapts to market conditions
Performance-based strategy weight adjustment system
Ensemble approach combining multiple signal sources
Professional Trading Features:

Real-time data ingestion for multiple cryptocurrency pairs
Comprehensive trade logging with strategy attribution
Advanced risk management with dynamic stops
Professional Streamlit interface with confidence scoring
Real-time performance metrics and drawdown tracking
Future Advanced Features:
The plan includes your sophisticated requirements like LSTM/Prophet/Transformer models, OKX API integration with futures trading, FreqAI-level ML capabilities, and comprehensive backtesting frameworks as natural progressions from the intelligent foundation we'll build.

This approach ensures we create a genuinely AI-powered system from the start, not just a basic trading bot, while building toward the full-featured professional trading platform you've envisioned.
