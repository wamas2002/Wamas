# Objective:
# Add intelligent, non-destructive enhancements to the current AI crypto trading system
# to improve adaptability, execution efficiency, and overall profitability.

# Scope of Improvements:
# 1. Confidence Optimization with Online Learning
# 2. Order Book Awareness Module
# 3. Smart Execution Strategies (TWAP/Iceberg)
# 4. Anomaly Detection & Guardrails
# 5. Regime-Specific SL/TP Strategy
# 6. Volatility-Based Stop Loss
# 7. Portfolio Rotation Logic
# 8. Equity Curve Drawdown Protection
# 9. Remote Mobile-Controlled Emergency Stop API

# Task List:
# ✅ Create ai/online_confidence_tuner.py
#     - Analyze past trade performance and dynamically adjust model signal weightings
#     - Optional: Q-learning or Bayesian tuning for multi-signal ensembles

# ✅ Create execution/order_book_monitor.py
#     - Connect to OKX order book depth stream
#     - Track bid/ask imbalance, spread, spoofing signals
#     - Filter trades when spread > 0.3% or spoofing suspected

# ✅ Create execution/smart_order_executor.py
#     - Implement TWAP or Iceberg logic to split large orders
#     - Automatically choose best execution mode based on liquidity

# ✅ Create monitoring/anomaly_detector.py
#     - Detect when BUY/SELL ratio exceeds thresholds (e.g., >90% BUYs)
#     - Detect high drawdown streaks or abnormal volume/volatility spikes

# ✅ Update risk_manager.py
#     - Implement Regime-Based Stop Loss & Take Profit logic
#     - Use ADX, ATR, and MACD to adapt risk dynamically

# ✅ Create portfolio/rotation_engine.py
#     - Rank pairs weekly by average P&L or Sharpe ratio
#     - Allocate capital toward top 10 performers, deallocate from bottom 10

# ✅ Create portfolio/drawdown_guard.py
#     - Monitor equity curve drawdown over rolling window
#     - Trigger soft system pause if >8% drawdown over 10 trades

# ✅ Create api/remote_control.py
#     - Secure endpoint for emergency STOP from mobile or cloud trigger
#     - Use API key + webhook for secure remote access

# Notes:
# - Do NOT modify core ML models (predictor.py, ensemble.py)
# - All new modules must be optional and modular
# - Ensure logging of all smart modules to separate DB tables
# - Maintain system uptime and real-time trading during upgrades

# Deployment:
# Test each module independently
# Deploy only after passing dry-run simulation
# Include unit tests for risk and anomaly modules
