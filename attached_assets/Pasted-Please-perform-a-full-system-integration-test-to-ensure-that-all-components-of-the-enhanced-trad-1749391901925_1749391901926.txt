Please perform a **full-system integration test** to ensure that all components of the enhanced trading system are functioning together correctly, especially after the successful integration of the advanced ML pipeline with 158 features.

âœ… Test Objectives:

1. **Machine Learning Pipeline:**
   - Verify all 158 features are generated correctly from real OKX data.
   - Confirm training works with both basic and enhanced ensemble models (GradientBoosting, RandomForest, etc.).
   - Test prediction flow: real-time data â†’ feature engineering â†’ model â†’ prediction.

2. **Trading Engine Integration:**
   - Ensure trading engine receives AI signals and acts on them with proper position sizing and execution.
   - Confirm bidirectional data flow between prediction outputs and order placement logic.
   - Validate that predictions result in trades if conditions are met.

3. **Live Data Feeds:**
   - Ensure real-time market data from OKX is correctly used across:
     â€¢ ML training
     â€¢ Signal generation
     â€¢ Risk management
     â€¢ Portfolio tracking

4. **Analytics & Dashboards:**
   - Confirm analytics pages (e.g. `/analytics`, `/ai-dashboard`, `/performance-report`) display results from the updated models and trading logs.
   - Ensure feature importance, ensemble charts, and model insights render correctly without errors.

5. **Risk Management System:**
   - Verify integration with new ML outputs (e.g., confidence thresholds, volatility-adjusted sizing).
   - Test drawdown controls, circuit breakers, and emergency stop functionality.

6. **AI Model Control Interface:**
   - Validate model retraining scheduler works (24â€“48 hour cycle).
   - Test switching between ML strategies in UI and that changes affect trading logic.

7. **System Cohesion:**
   - Confirm all components (ML engine, trading bot, dashboards, analytics, portfolio) work in sync.
   - No outdated data or mock placeholders should exist.
   - Logs should show coordinated execution of signals, trades, and metrics.

ðŸ“Œ Final Deliverables:
- âœ… Full integration test results
- âœ… Confirmation that live predictions are powering real trades
- âœ… No errors in model rendering, analytics, or trading loop
- âœ… Performance benchmarks post-enhancement

Please verify, fix any integration issues, and provide a summary report of full system health and inter-component synchronization.
