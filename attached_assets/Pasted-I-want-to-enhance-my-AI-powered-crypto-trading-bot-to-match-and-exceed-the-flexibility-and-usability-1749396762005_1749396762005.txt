I want to enhance my AI-powered crypto trading bot to match and exceed the flexibility and usability of Gunbot. Please implement the following features:

✅ 1. Add Prebuilt Strategy Presets
Component: /strategies/presets
Functionality:

Implement the following reusable strategies with modular parameters:

Grid Strategy: Place staggered buy/sell orders

DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging): Buy more after a drop by X%

Trailing Stop ATR: Use ATR to determine trailing SL/TP levels

Ping-Pong Strategy: Trade between two price bands

Breakout Strategy: Enter on volatility spikes

Allow switching between strategies via dashboard or API.

⚙️ 2. Implement AutoConfig Engine
Component: /engine/autoconfig
Functionality:

Auto-detect market regime (trending, ranging, high-volatility)

Dynamically assign best-fit strategy for each symbol based on:

Volume > X

Volatility index (std deviation or ATR)

AI signal confidence

Example: If market is trending with low volatility, enable EMA cross strategy.

🧪 3. Backtest Presets
Component: /backtest
Functionality:

Allow backtesting of all strategy presets across historical data

Visualize:

Win rate

Avg PnL

Max drawdown

Equity curve

Optional: export to CSV or JSON

🧑‍💻 4. UI Enhancements
Dashboard Updates:

Add Beginner/Expert toggle

Beginner mode: Basic metrics (Balance, Win Rate, PnL)

Expert mode: Strategy tuning, feature importance, log viewer

Add interactive charting (Plotly.js or embed TradingView)

Strategy editor per symbol:

Enable/disable

Set SL/TP, frequency, allocation

📢 5. Telegram Bot Command Integration
Component: /telegram/commands
Functionality:

Add these command triggers:

/status BTC → shows active strategy, balance, open trades

/enable DCA BTC → enables DCA for BTC

/disable strategy BTC → disables strategy for BTC

/risk 3% → changes risk parameter globally

Connect to Telegram bot with webhook or polling.

Please make sure these additions integrate with the existing:

Risk management system

AI model prediction engine

Real-time market data pipeline

Let me know when these modules are complete, and I’ll review performance
