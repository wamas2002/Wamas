# 🧠 Objective:
# Enhance the Elite Trading Dashboard (port 3000) with professional-grade UI and functionality
# — in a single development branch — without modifying or disrupting the core trading system
# (ai/, trading/, execution/, or ML models).

# 🔒 Non-Destructive Directive:
# DO NOT modify:
#   - Core ML models in ai/
#   - Core signal logic in trading/
#   - Execution flows in execution/
#   - Main script engines (signal_execution_bridge.py, pure_local_trading_engine.py, etc.)

# ✅ Upgrade Targets: Elite Dashboard (dashboard/elite_dashboard.py, port 3000)

## 1. 🔍 Signal Explorer Tab
- Add real-time filtering:
  • Confidence % (slider)
  • Signal type (BUY/SELL)
  • Source engine (dropdown: Pure Local, AI Optimizer, Futures)
- Display: timestamp, model used, regime, PnL expectancy
- Data source: /api/signals → connected to signals.db or active memory

## 2. 📊 Performance Analytics Tab
- Show:
  • Equity curve (real PnL from trade logs)
  • Win rate, Sharpe ratio, avg. holding time
  • Realized/unrealized PnL
- Pull from portfolio database or real-time API `/api/portfolio_metrics`

## 3. 🔔 Notification Center
- Add dismissible alerts for:
  • Executed trades
  • Signal anomalies
  • Risk triggers (drawdown, overbuy, etc.)
- Display via WebSocket or polling `/api/alerts`

## 4. ⚙️ Engine Control Panel
- Add toggles to activate/deactivate each engine:
  • Pure Local
  • Enhanced AI
  • Futures
- Display current engine status using `/api/engine_status`

## 5. 📉 Confidence Trends Chart
- Graph confidence levels of last 25 signals
- Color code:
  • Green: Profitable
  • Red: Loss
- Overlay regime detection zones (bull/bear/sideways)

## 6. 📈 Portfolio Overview Panel
- Real-time data:
  • USDT balance
  • Current open trades
  • Allocation per symbol
- Source: OKX WebSocket and `/api/portfolio`

## 7. 🚀 UI & Technical Polish
- Auto-refresh (every 15s via WebSocket)
- Responsive layout with tabbed interface
- Async data fetching for large tables
- Lazy load inactive charts/tabs
- Page loading spinner while connecting

## 8. 🔒 Internal Security Enforcement
- NO public API endpoints exposed
- All backend routes behind authenticated session
- Use Flask app context and `@login_required` decorators

# ✅ Final Deployment Result:
An elite dashboard with interactive trading intelligence, live OKX metrics, AI insights, real signals, and secure modular components — all running independently of core logic.
