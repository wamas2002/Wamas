ðŸ§  TASK: Final QA Verification for Full Deployment Readiness of Elite AI Trading System (Port 5000)

OBJECTIVE:
Ensure every module in the system â€” signal generation, execution, dashboard, backend, and ML models â€” is fully synchronized, data-authentic, and error-free.

SCOPE:

1. âœ… Signal Classification & Tagging
   - All signals must include:
     â€¢ symbol
     â€¢ market_type = 'spot' or 'futures'
     â€¢ trade_direction = 'long', 'short', or 'spot'
     â€¢ confidence score
     â€¢ timestamp
     â€¢ action (BUY/SELL)
   - Pure Local / Direct Auto â†’ spot
   - Futures Engine / Optimizer â†’ futures
   - Ensure proper audit logging per signal (signal_id, market_type, timestamp, engine)

2. âœ… Dashboard (Port 5000)
   - No mock/sandbox data â€“ only live OKX data via secure auth
   - Active WebSocket connection broadcasting:
     â€¢ portfolio_update
     â€¢ signals_update
     â€¢ performance_update
   - All tabs and navigation functional
   - Filter by Spot/Futures/All works
   - Badges: blue = futures, green = spot
   - Direction: ðŸ”¼ long / ðŸ”½ short / ðŸŸ¢ spot
   - Real trade metrics: portfolio value, P&L, active signals, win rate

3. âœ… Execution Engines
   - spot_executor.py only triggers OKX spot orders
   - futures_executor.py handles futures with leverage
   - Separation must be strict and confirmed

4. âœ… API Integrity
   - Routes tested: `/api/signal_feed`, `/api/dashboard_data`, `/api/portfolio`, `/api/performance`
   - Responses include full live data & correct `market_type`
   - Backend logic untouched: no breakage to ML models, Q-learning, or regime detection

5. âœ… Model Verification
   - LSTM / Prophet / Transformer / Q-learning modules unchanged
   - Confidence score valid and tracked
   - Real-time regime detection active

6. âœ… UX Enhancements
   - Notification center non-intrusive
   - Advanced toggles and strategy tabs active
   - Multi-portfolio view enabled (optional)
   - Leverage and strategy name shown per signal

7. âœ… Final Checks
   - No errors in browser console or backend logs
   - .env keys securely loaded (no exposure)
   - Refresh, Stop, Resume buttons tested
   - End-to-end trade test (spot + futures)
   - All updates appear within 15â€“30 seconds

REQUIREMENT:
System must pass all checks above before pushing to production. Use this prompt to validate or trigger automated test flows.

DELIVERABLE:
âœ… Return full QA report showing system state for:
â€¢ Signal stream
â€¢ Trade flow
â€¢ Portfolio metrics
â€¢ UI/UX function
â€¢ Real OKX sync

DO NOT PROCEED TO DEPLOY UNTIL 100% PASSED.
