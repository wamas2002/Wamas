finalize the migration of your entire system to the modern UI served at http://localhost:5001, ensuring all features, real data, and backend logic are fully integrated and the old version (:5000) is deprecated:

⸻

✅ Prompt: Migrate All Features & Data to Modern UI (:5001) and Retire Legacy Interface (:5000)

🎯 Objective:
Transfer the entire trading system (data, logic, features) to the modern Flask-based UI at http://localhost:5001, ensuring that it fully replaces the original Streamlit app on port :5000.

⸻

🔁 Migration Tasks

1. Transfer All Functional Modules

Move or replicate all critical components from :5000 into :5001:
	•	✅ Real-time OKX portfolio display and updates
	•	✅ AI model insights (LSTM, GradientBoost, Ensemble, etc.)
	•	✅ Strategy Builder (Drag-and-Drop interface)
	•	✅ Risk Manager with multi-level TP/SL
	•	✅ Live charts and market data (via TradingView widgets)
	•	✅ Real-time alerts and performance analytics
	•	✅ Full-featured Dashboard, Portfolio, Analytics, and AI pages

2. Integrate Data & Model Connections

Ensure :5001 fully accesses:
	•	✅ Real OKX API data for all USDT pairs
	•	✅ Live model predictions (from backend ML pipeline)
	•	✅ Real-time portfolio positions (including PI, BTC, ETH, etc.)
	•	✅ Historical data, logs, and trade records

All these should be fetched directly, not redirected through :5000.

3. Shut Down Legacy Streamlit App (:5000)
	•	Remove or disable the Streamlit interface on port :5000
	•	Redirect any remaining internal calls or data dependencies to the new Flask interface
	•	Confirm no component is still dependent on the old Streamlit session or cache

4. Verify Full System Integration in New UI
	•	✅ Confirm all pages in :5001 pull live data
	•	✅ Charts reflect real-time OKX activity
	•	✅ AI models and predictions are synced
	•	✅ Alerts, logs, and dashboard widgets are updated live
	•	✅ TradingView charts are responsive and functional

🔒 Final Requirement

Ensure backward compatibility is maintained at the backend level, but all user interactions, monitoring, and strategy management must now occur through http://localhost:5001.

“Modern UI is now the primary and only interface, all features successfully migrated.”
