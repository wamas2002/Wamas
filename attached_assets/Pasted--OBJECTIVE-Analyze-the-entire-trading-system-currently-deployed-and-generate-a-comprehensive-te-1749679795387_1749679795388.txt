🧠 OBJECTIVE:
Analyze the entire trading system currently deployed and generate a **comprehensive technical report** that explains how it works, without changing any functionality or deleting any components.

✅ TASK:
Conduct a full internal audit of the system and produce a report that includes:

1. 🔁 **Workflow Overview**  
   - Describe how the system works step-by-step from:
     - Market data intake (e.g., OKX, Binance)
     - AI model predictions
     - Risk evaluation
     - Trade execution
     - Portfolio tracking

2. 🧰 **Technology Stack & Architecture**
   - Identify and explain all frameworks, libraries, and languages used:
     - Backend (e.g., Python, FastAPI, Flask)
     - Frontend (React, HTML, JS, TradingView widgets)
     - WebSockets and API integrations (e.g., OKX API)
     - Databases (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)

3. 🤖 **AI & Machine Learning Models**
   - List all AI models in use (LSTM, Prophet, GradientBoost, Ensemble, etc.)
   - Describe the training pipeline, input features, and how models are selected dynamically
   - Highlight performance tracking (accuracy %, confidence score)

4. 📈 **Trading Strategy Engine**
   - Document the strategies used (Grid, Scalping, Mean Reversion, etc.)
   - Show how the Strategy Selector assigns strategies based on market conditions
   - Mention dynamic switching and real-time optimization

5. 🛡️ **Risk Management Framework**
   - Explain how position sizing is done (Kelly Criterion, volatility-based, etc.)
   - Include SL/TP logic, max risk per trade, and portfolio diversification logic

6. 🖥️ **User Interface Overview**
   - Describe how the UI is structured across ports (e.g., :3000, :5000)
   - Mention TradingView chart integrations, dashboards, and monitoring tools
   - Show how live OKX data is visualized and how users interact with the system

7. 🔄 **Live Data Flow**
   - Map how real-time data flows through the system
   - Show which modules consume which data
   - Confirm live feeds vs. historical data vs. backtesting components

✅ OUTPUT:
- A plain text or Markdown `.md` report file
- Clearly structured with headings and bullet points
- DO NOT make any backend modifications, deletions, or restarts — report only
- Save report to: `/reports/system_overview.md`
