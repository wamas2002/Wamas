Perform a full system-wide verification and trading performance analysis with the following goals:

⸻

🧩 System Health Check
	1.	Validate that all components (frontend, backend, database, API) are running without errors.
	2.	Confirm that all modules (AI engine, trading execution, analytics, dashboards) are connected and responding correctly.
	3.	Verify that all symbols are fetched from OKX in both Spot and Futures, with real-time prices.
	4.	Ensure all background services (model retraining, strategy assignment, risk alerts) are active.

⸻

📊 Trading Data Verification
	1.	Check last 72 hours of executed trades: entry time, symbol, buy/sell action, price, result (P/L).
	2.	Identify number of trades executed per symbol and per strategy.
	3.	Highlight any missing SELL signals or trades that didn’t close positions.

⸻

🧠 AI Model Evaluation
	1.	Compare model predictions with actual price movements — calculate directional accuracy and average prediction error.
	2.	Identify the best-performing models (LSTM, Prophet, Gradient Boosting, etc.) and their current win rate.
	3.	Log retraining success or errors for each model.

⸻

📈 Strategy Effectiveness
	1.	Evaluate performance of each assigned strategy across the top 10 USDT pairs.
	2.	List strategies with over 60% win rate.
	3.	Analyze effectiveness of Smart Strategy Selector over last 5 cycles.

⸻

⚠️ Risk & Protection System
	1.	Confirm Stop Loss / Take Profit rules were triggered correctly.
	2.	Check if any Circuit Breaker or Emergency Stop event occurred.
	3.	Report any symbol breaching drawdown limits or loss thresholds.

⸻
