# 🚀 Goal:
# Enhance the existing trading system with advanced, modular features that improve visibility, usability, and performance —
# without altering any of the core trading logic, AI models, or data pipelines.

# 🔒 Constraints:
# - DO NOT modify core backend (model training, execution engine, database schema, OKX data handlers)
# - Maintain full compatibility with live data sources and all current modules
# - Only ADD new frontend components or parallel helper modules

# ✅ New Features to Implement:

## 1. 📊 Multi-Timeframe + Multi-Chart Analysis (MTFA)
# - Add the ability to view multiple TradingView widget charts per symbol (1h, 4h, 1d, 1w)
# - Embed within dashboard and strategy builder pages using tabbed or side-by-side layout
# - Ensure charts reflect real-time data for the selected pair

## 2. 🧠 AI Explainability & Model Insights
# - Add a panel that shows:
#   - Model used (e.g., GradientBoost, LSTM)
#   - Confidence score
#   - Feature importance rankings
#   - Explanation of why a trade signal was generated
# - Integrate SHAP, LIME, or surrogate explainers if available, or fallback to rule-based summary

## 3. 🔍 Real-Time Screener / Signal Scanner
# - Scan all supported pairs every X minutes for:
#   - Trade signals from AI models
#   - Strategy triggers (e.g., RSI cross, MACD divergence)
#   - Volatility spikes or volume surges
# - Display in a new "📡 Screener" tab with sortable results

## 4. 🧪 Advanced Backtesting Visualization
# - Improve existing backtest interface to include:
#   - Equity curve
#   - Drawdown chart
#   - Trade-by-trade profit heatmap
#   - Annotated TradingView chart with entry/exit markers
# - Allow comparison between strategies and models

## 5. 💼 Enhanced Portfolio Management
# - Add deeper analytics to portfolio tab:
#   - Daily/weekly/monthly P&L summaries
#   - Allocation donut chart by symbol & strategy
#   - Sharpe ratio, win rate, max drawdown
# - Include an option to simulate portfolio rebalancing suggestions (read-only)

## 6. 🌐 Multi-Exchange Support (Optional but Future-Ready)
# - Scaffold support for additional exchanges (e.g., Binance, KuCoin) using modular API adapter pattern
# - For now, just allow user to input alternate API credentials via UI
# - Keep OKX as the only active exchange unless user explicitly switches

# 🖥 UI/UX Integration:
# - All new features must integrate into existing design framework (Flask/Streamlit or HTML/CSS frontend)
# - Must use real data from OKX API unless explicitly in simulation mode
# - Use TradingView widgets wherever charting is needed

# ✅ Final Output:
# - Each module must be isolated, non-intrusive, and seamlessly integrate with the existing UI
# - Confirm no disruption to the current workflow or data integrity
