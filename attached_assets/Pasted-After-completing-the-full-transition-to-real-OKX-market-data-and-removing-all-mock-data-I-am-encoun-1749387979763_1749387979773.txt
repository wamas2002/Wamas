After completing the full transition to real OKX market data and removing all mock data, I am encountering the following critical issues:

1. Feature Importance (AI Model Visualization)
Error: `argument of type 'TradingEngine' is not iterable`
→ Action: Fix the code block where the `TradingEngine` class is being incorrectly passed or treated as a dictionary/iterable. Possibly caused by `for key in trading_engine:` or similar. Use proper method to access features from the AI model.

2. Ensemble Strategy Analysis
Error: `argument of type 'TradingEngine' is not iterable`
→ Action: Refactor the ensemble analysis logic to avoid trying to iterate over the `TradingEngine` object. Likely a missing `.strategies` or `.model_results` attribute being referenced incorrectly.

3. Futures Trading Panel
Message: `⚠️ Please configure OKX API credentials in the sidebar to enable live trading`
→ Action: Fix the sidebar logic to correctly pass the credentials into the futures module. Ensure API key/secret/passphrase are being passed to both spot and futures clients. Also validate the connection using `okx.fetch_balance()`.

4. Model Predictions
Message: `No market data available for predictions`
→ Action: Ensure the AI model receives live data from OKX correctly. Possibly a `None` or empty list being passed due to missing symbol or timeframe. Add fallback or error handling if real-time data is not yet fetched.

5. Walk-forward Analysis
Error: `Insufficient data for walk-forward analysis`
→ Action: Increase the amount of historical OHLCV data fetched (e.g., fetch 1000+ candles). Validate that the model receives both train/test segments. Add a message to UI if insufficient data is detected.

6. Error: `'TradingEngine' object has no attribute 'get'`
→ Action: Find where `.get` is being called on `TradingEngine` (likely in a dictionary context). Refactor to use methods like `trading_engine.get_current_price()` or replace with correct dictionary/object usage.

Please resolve the above issues and retest the analytics dashboard, ensemble AI insights, futures panel, and prediction components. Make sure they are fully functional with live OKX market data only.
