Please perform a comprehensive verification and enhancement of the entire trading bot system to ensure that it is fully functional, optimized, and using only authentic real-time OKX market data.

✅ System Integration & Health Check:
Verify full integration of all system components:

Live OKX connection (2,400+ markets available)

Real-time market data streaming for all active pairs

AI model functionality (LSTM, Prophet, XGBoost, CatBoost, RandomForest, GradientBoosting)

Risk management module (position sizing, stop-loss, circuit breaker, drawdown tracking)

Strategy engine (ensemble voting, confidence threshold, volatility-aware rebalancing)

Web and API interfaces (all dashboards/pages reachable)

Ensure all modules are connected and communicating properly:

No dependency issues

Data flows seamlessly between components

No mock/sandbox/placeholder data in use

📈 Strategy & Dashboard Enhancements:
Add or validate the following:

Strategy switching from the dashboard (LSTM ↔ Prophet ↔ Boosting models)

Visual confidence scores (e.g., “Buy BTC - 87% Confidence”)

Risk alerts:

3 consecutive losing trades

Daily loss exceeds 5%

Sudden volatility spikes > 20%

Improve dashboard UX:

Real-time performance chart (PnL over time)

Open/closed trades table with timestamps and profit

Visualized portfolio allocation with live OKX balance

🚨 Error Recovery & Real-Time Monitoring:
Ensure proper error handling is active:

Retry logic for failed API calls

Graceful fallback for missing symbols

Circuit breaker functionality

Enable real-time logging & monitoring:

Live trade execution log

Portfolio updates every 5 seconds

Market condition (bullish/bearish/neutral) detector feedback

📊 Final Deliverables:
✅ A full status report of each module (connected / working / error)

⏱ Latency measurements: Signal → Execution delay

🔁 Confirmation that live trading is enabled (not sandbox mode)

📁 Summary of current live portfolio (real OKX account data)

🛠 Recommendations for further improvements (if any)

Please begin the audit and reply with the full technical report once complete.
The goal is to ensure production-readiness, complete automation, and maximum reliability.
