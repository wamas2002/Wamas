### 2. Fundamental Analysis Section - **COMPLETED**
**Before:** Static scores (BTC: 77.2, ETH: 76.7, PI: 58.8)  
**After:** Live data from `real_data_service.get_real_fundamental_analysis()`

**Replaced Elements:**
- Fundamental scores: Calculated from real market cap, development activity, community metrics
- Recommendations: Dynamic BUY/HOLD/SELL based on current market conditions
- Market analysis: Real-time assessment of institutional adoption and network strength

### 3. Technical Analysis Signals - **COMPLETED**
**Before:** Hardcoded signals (MACD Bullish, RSI Oversold, etc.)

**After:** Authentic data from `real_data_service.get_real_ai_performance()`

**Replaced Elements:**
- Model accuracy: Live tracking from AI performance database
- Best performing model: Dynamic selection based on recent performance
- Active models count: Real count of operational AI models
- Recent predictions: Actual count from last 6 hours of trading

### 5. Risk Management Analytics - **COMPLETED**
**Before:** Hardcoded risk metrics (99.5% concentration, 85% volatility)  
**After:** Dynamic calculation from `real_data_service.get_real_risk_metrics()`

**Replaced Elements:**
- Concentration risk: Real-time calculation from actual portfolio positions
- Portfolio volatility: Dynamic calculation based on position variance
- Risk score: Live assessment using multi-factor risk model
- VaR calculations: Authentic Value at Risk based on portfolio composition

real_data_service.py
├── OKX Market Data Integration (ccxt.okx)
├── Portfolio Data Authentication
├── AI Performance Tracking
├── Fundamental Analysis Engine
├── Technical Analysis Calculator
├── Risk Metrics Calculator
└── Data Authenticity Validator
```

### Data Flow Validation
```
OKX Live API → Real Data Service → UI Components
     ↓              ↓                ↓
   No Mock      Authentic Only    Live Updates
```
